Few Instructions:

1. In this project, I use SASS preprocessor, bootstrap. I include the SASS file within the projects.
   All the partials are available in the css folder.

   Without installing the sass, anyone can see the project. All the js and css files include in
   the folder. 


Sass Installation -

1. Please Install Ruby in Windows PC.    https://rubyinstaller.org/

2. Open Ruby Command promt and install sass by writing -
   gem install sass

3. After successfully install, just tell SASS to watch the main style.scss file in the css folder.
   
   sass --watch style.scss

Thats it! Cheers!
